## Using the issue tracker

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tmtbe/netpurr/issues) is the preferred channel
for [bug reports](#bug-reports) and [features requests](#feature-requests).

Please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

## Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful -
thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.
1. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or development branch in
   the repository.
1. **Demonstrate the problem** &mdash; provide clear steps that can be reproduced.

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as
possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experienced the problem?
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help to fix any potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the
project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible.
